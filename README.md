Question: A new Ride sharing company is entering the market in Lagos and they would like to make sure they don't mix up their commission from rides taken by independent riders on the platform. How can Flutterwave solve this? 

ANSWER:
Flutterwave can solve this issue for the ride-sharing company by training them on the sub account and split payment features.
-Firstly, the ride-sharing company needs to create an account on the Fluttterwave dashboard that would enable them make live and sandboxed API calls to Flutterwave API end points.
-Thereafter, the ride-sharing company needs to create a sub-account on their Flutterwave dashboard for every registered driver on their platform. 
The ride-sharing company will then implement the rave split payment feature using their rave API and the sub-account ID. Rave's split payment feature allows you split a transaction between two (2) or more accounts and collect fees on the transaction. 
This split payment feature will allows the ride-sharing company to collect payments and revenue as commission based on percentage.
This feature automatically split the settlement based on type of split set(flat or percentage) between the ride-sharing company and the sub-account. The registered sub-account gets credited and the ride sharing company gets their own commission credited as well.
